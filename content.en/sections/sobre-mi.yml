      **Hello, I'm Beatriz López!**

      Physiotherapist and osteopath committed to my work.

      My goal is to be your partner in the journey to a healthy life free of limitations.

      With a solid background in physiotherapy, I am ready to offer you a complete and effective treatment.

      I did my internship at the Hospital Clínico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, where I specialized in respiratory, neurological, traumatological and breast cancer unit physiotherapy, as well as in private clinics where I gained experience with adult and pediatric patients.

      Likewise, my constant search for knowledge has led me to obtain complementary training, taking courses such as pediatric respiratory physiotherapy, dry needling and electro-puncture and instrumental fibrolysis, as well as a two-year master's degree in structural osteopathy from the EOM.

      Currently, I am immersed in a 3-year master's degree in visceral and cranial osteopathy from the EOM.
